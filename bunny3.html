        Lionhead Rabbit Breed Origin
    </p>
    <p class="bunnypar">
        Who could possibly resist this fluffy ball of goofiness? A popular pet that is loving and easy to train, this rabbit breed has a lot to offer to every owner. The Lionhead rabbit’s origin started in Belgium when breeders decided to mate a Swiss Fox with a Netherland Dwarf. The result was a rabbit with a genetic mutation causing wool to appear around the head and on the flanks and it became known as the “mane” gene. The Lionhead rabbit grew in popularity in Europe until finally, they made their way to the United States in the late ’90s. In 2014, this breed was officially accepted into the American Rabbit Breeders Association (ARBA).<br>

        In most cases the Lionhead is a friendly and well mannered pet, although they can be quite skittish if they don't feel safe. It is possible to train a Lionhead as they are very smart creatures. They can comprehend certain orders such as, come, play, and eat. Clicker training is now becoming popular. Lionhead rabbits can be litter trained, and make suitable house rabbits. Like all rabbits, if the Lionhead is treated kindly and well handled, they make great family pets. As with all rabbits, Lionheads should be kept in pairs at the very least as they are very sociable creatures. <br>
